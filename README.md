# first-experiment-repository

Hey Guys, I am Gaurav Jadhav from India.
I am currently in USA to pursue my Master's in Computer Science at University of Colorado Boulder.
This is my first step to get used to github and it's applications.

I'll be using this from now on and looking forward to have a good journey here.

ok bye!
